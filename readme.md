# Build a Cat Blog Page  

Exercises are based on the [freeCodeCamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org) curriculum. All solutions are my own work.  

### Step 1  
In this workshop, you will practice working with semantic HTML by building a blog page dedicated to Mr. Whiskers the cat.  
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
 <head>
  <title>Mr. Whiskers' Blog</title>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  </head>
 <body>
  </body>
 </html>
```  

The first section you will build out is the page *header*.  
The `header` element is used to represent introductory content like page navigation and other introductory information.  

Here is an example using the `header` element:  
**Example Code**  
```html
<header>
  <h1>Main Page Title Goes Here</h1>
  <img src="example-logo.png" alt="Example logo" />
</header>
```  

Inside the `body` element, add a `header` element.  


### Step 2  
The header will be responsible for displaying the main title, image, and page navigation for the blog.  
Inside the `header` element, add an `h1` with the text of `Welcome to Mr. Whiskers' Blog Page!`.  


### Step 3  
In this introductory content, you will want to show an image of Mr. Whiskers with a caption.  
Below the an `h1` element, start by adding `figure` element.  
Inside the `figure` element, add an `img` element.  
The `src` attribute of the `img` should have a value of `"https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-photo-gallery/1.jpg"` and the `alt` text should have a value of `"a cat in the garden"`.  
Below your `img` element, add a `figcaption` with the text `Mr. Whiskers in the Garden`.  


### Step 4  
For your blog, there should be a way for users to navigate to different sections on the page.  

The `nav` element is used to provide navigation links to other sections in the document or other sections in the website. A lot of times you will see the `nav` element used for menus or table of contents.  

Here is an example of using the `nav` element:  

**Example Code**  
```html
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
    <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```  

Below your `figure` add a `nav` element with a `ul` element nested inside.  
Inside the `ul` element, add three `li` elements.  


### Step 5  
Inside each of the `li` elements, you will need to have an anchor element.  

For the first anchor element, the text should be `About` and the `href` attribute value should be `"#about"`. 
The hash symbol in front of `about` represents an `id` name, which will be added later in the project.  

For the second anchor element, the text should be `Posts` and the `href` attribute value should be `"#posts"`.  

For the third anchor element, the text should be `Contact` and the `href` attribute value should be `"#contact"`.  


### Step 6  
Now that you are finished building out the page header, you will need to start adding your main content.  

Below your `header`, add a `main` element.  


### Step 7  
The first section on the page will be the *about* section. The section will introduce Mr. Whiskers and give users an idea of what this blog is about.  

Inside your `main` element, add a `section` element with the `id` attribute set to `"about"`.  

Inside the `section` element, add an `h2` with the text of `About`.  


### Step 8  
Below your `h2` element, add a paragraph element with the text of `Hi there! I'm Jane Doe, a passionate writer who finds endless inspiration in the antics of my beloved cat, Mr. Whiskers.`  

Below your paragraph element, add another paragraph element with the text of `His playful nature and boundless energy keep me on my toes. I love him so much.`  


### Step 9  
Now that you have added the about section, try clicking on the `About` link to see the page jump down to that section.  

The next section in the blog page will be a list of posts talking about Mr. Whiskers.  

Add another `section` element with an `id` set to `"posts"`.  

Inside the `section` element, add an `h2` element with the text of `Posts` .
