# Build a Cat Blog Page  

Exercises are based on the [freeCodeCamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org) curriculum. All solutions are my own work.  

### Step 1  
In this workshop, you will practice working with semantic HTML by building a blog page dedicated to Mr. Whiskers the cat.  

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Mr. Whiskers' Blog</title>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```  

The first section you will build out is the page *header*.  

The `header` element is used to represent introductory content like page navigation and other introductory information.  

Here is an example using the `header` element:  

**Example Code**  
```html
<header>
  <h1>Main Page Title Goes Here</h1>
  <img src="example-logo.png" alt="Example logo" />
</header>
```  

Inside the `body` element, add a `header` element.  


### Step 2  
The header will be responsible for displaying the main title, image, and page navigation for the blog.  

Inside the `header` element, add an `h1` with the text of `Welcome to Mr. Whiskers' Blog Page!`.  


### Step 3  
In this introductory content, you will want to show an image of Mr. Whiskers with a caption.  

Below the an `h1` element, start by adding `figure` element.  

Inside the `figure` element, add an `img` element.  

The `src` attribute of the `img` should have a value of `"https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-photo-gallery/1.jpg"` and the `alt` text should have a value of `"a cat in the garden"`.  

Below your `img` element, add a `figcaption` with the text `Mr. Whiskers in the Garden`.  


### Step 4  
For your blog, there should be a way for users to navigate to different sections on the page.  

The `nav` element is used to provide navigation links to other sections in the document or other sections in the website. A lot of times you will see the `nav` element used for menus or table of contents.  

Here is an example of using the `nav` element:  

**Example Code**  
```html
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
    <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```  

Below your `figure` add a `nav` element with a `ul` element nested inside.  

Inside the `ul` element, add three `li` elements.  


### Step 5  
Inside each of the `li` elements, you will need to have an anchor element.  

For the first anchor element, the text should be `About` and the `href` attribute value should be `"#about"`. 
The hash symbol in front of `about` represents an `id` name, which will be added later in the project.  

For the second anchor element, the text should be `Posts` and the `href` attribute value should be `"#posts"`.  

For the third anchor element, the text should be `Contact` and the `href` attribute value should be `"#contact"`.  


### Step 6  
Now that you are finished building out the page header, you will need to start adding your main content.  

Below your `header`, add a `main` element.  


### Step 7  
The first section on the page will be the *about* section. The section will introduce Mr. Whiskers and give users an idea of what this blog is about.  

Inside your `main` element, add a `section` element with the `id` attribute set to `"about"`.  

Inside the `section` element, add an `h2` with the text of `About`.  


### Step 8  
Below your `h2` element, add a paragraph element with the text of `Hi there! I'm Jane Doe, a passionate writer who finds endless inspiration in the antics of my beloved cat, Mr. Whiskers.`  

Below your paragraph element, add another paragraph element with the text of `His playful nature and boundless energy keep me on my toes. I love him so much.`  


### Step 9  
Now that you have added the about section, try clicking on the `About` link to see the page jump down to that section.  

The next section in the blog page will be a list of posts talking about Mr. Whiskers.  

Add another `section` element with an `id` set to `"posts"`.  

Inside the `section` element, add an `h2` element with the text of `Posts`.  


### Step 10  
For the first blog post, you will use an *article* element.  

The `article` element represents self contained content on a web page.  

**Example Code**  
```html
<article>
  <h1>Example heading</h1>
    <p>Example article text</p>
</article>
```  

Below the `h2` element, add an `article` element.  

Inside the `article` element, add an `h3` element with the text `Mr. Whiskers' First Day Home`.  

The reason an `h3` is used here is that maintaining a proper structural hierarchy for heading elements is important. Since the posts subheading is an `h2` element, the next level down in the hierarchy would be an `h3`.  


### Step 11  
This blog post is going to contain a couple of paragraphs with *lorem ipsum* text.  

Lorem ipsum is commonly used in web development to serve as placeholder text. It is useful when you want to focus on building out the basic structure of your web pages and not have to worry about the actual content just yet. Here is an example of using lorem ipsum:  

**Example Code**  
```html
<p>
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur
   adipisicing elit. Quisquam quod, voluptates,
  quae, quos quibusdam dolorum quia nemo
   repudiandae quidem voluptatum quas.
  Quisquam quod, voluptates, quae, quos
   quibusdam dolorum quia nemo repudiandae
  quidem voluptatum quas.
</p>
```  

Below your `h3` element, add two paragraphs of lorem ipsum text.  


### Step 12  
For the second blog post, you will need to add another `article` element.  

Inside the `article` element, add an `h3` element with the text of `Mr. Whiskers' First Bath`.  

Below your `h3` element, add two paragraphs of lorem ipsum text.  


### Step 13  
For the third blog post, you will need to add another `article` element.  

Inside the `article` element, add an `h3` element with the text of `Mr. Whiskers' First Birthday Party`.  

Below your `h3` element, add two paragraphs of lorem ipsum text.  


### Step 14  
Now that you have finished adding all of the blog posts, try clicking on the `Posts` link and you should see that the page jumps down to the `Posts` section.  

The last component to add to your blog page is going to be the contact section.  

Below the `main` element, add a `footer` element.  


### Step 15  
Inside the `footer` element, add a `section` element with an `id` set to `contact`.  

Inside the `section` element, add an `h2` element with the text of `Contact`.  


### Step 16  
Inside the contact section, you will want to show the blog author's contact information. You will use an *address* element for this.  

The `address` element is used to represent contact information for a person or organization.  

Here is an example using the `address` element for a physical address. The `br` element is used here to create a line break between the text.  

**Example Code**  
```html
<address>
  1234 Make Believe Lane <br />
  Pretend City, USA
</address>
```  

Below your `address` element, add an `h2` element.  


### Step 17  
For this step, you will need to add the phone number and email address for the blog author.  

Inside the `address` element, add a paragraph element with the text of `Phone: 555-555-5555`.  

Below that paragraph element, add another paragraph element with the text of `Email: fake@email.com`.  


### Step 18  
To improve user experience, you will want to enhance the phone number so that users tap on it and initiate a call.  

Here is how you can make phone numbers clickable:  

**Example Code**  
```html
<a href="tel:2345678912">234-567-8912</a>
```  

Wrap the text `555-555-5555` in an anchor element and use `tel:` to make it a clickable phone number.  


### Step 19  
Similarly, users should be able to click on the email address and send an email from their default email client.  

Here is how you can make email addresses clickable:  

**Example Code**  
```html
<a href="mailto:contact@company.com">contact@company.com</a>
```  

For this final step, wrap the text `fake@email.com` in an anchor element and use `mailto:` to make it a clickable email address.  

And with those changes, your blog page is now complete.
